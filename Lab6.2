Solve (manually) using Gaussian substitution:

(0) 4x1 − x2 + x3 = 8
(1) 2x1 + 5x2 + 2x3 = 3
(2) x1 + 2x2 + 4x3 = 11



Following the Gaussian Subtitution we have to multiply (1) by -2 and plus to equation (0). The same for (2), multiplying by -2 and plus to equation (1)

(0) 4x1 − x2 + x3 = 8
(1) -11x2 -3x3 = 2
(2) x2 -6x3 =-19

The next step will be multiply (2) per 11 and plus (1)

(0) 4x1 − x2 + x3 = 8
(1) -11x2 -3x3 = 2
(2) -69x3 = -207


After all of this substitution, we can form the next matrix A = [[4, -1 , 1], and we got the next vector b [8, 2, -207]
                                                                 [0, -11, -3]
                                                                 [0,   0,-69]]



We can see that the result are the same than in the lab. Being x3= -207/-69 = 3.  x2 = -1  x1= 1.


Now we have to do the same for the other equation

Solve (manually) using Gaussian substitution:


(0) 4x1 − x2 + 2x3 = 9
(1) 2x1 + 4x2 − x3 = −5
(2) x1 + x2 − 3x3 = −9

Following the Gaussian Subtitution we have to multiply (1) by -2 and plus to equation (0). The same for (2), multiplying by -2 and plus to equation (1)

(0) 4x1 − x2 + 2x3 = 9
(1) -9x2 + 4x3 = 19
(2) 53x3 = 155

After all of this substitution, we can form the next matrix A = [[4, -1 , 1], and we got the next vector b [9, 19, 155]
                                                                 [0, -9, 4]
                                                                 [0,   0, 53]]

We can see that the result are the same than in the lab. Being x3= 155/53 = 3.  x2 = -1  x1= 1.
