At the beginning we have the formula for the forward difference method for the second derivation:


f'' (x0) = (f(x0+h)-f(x0))/h

So first is necessary to calculate f'(x0 +h) with the first derivation:

f'(1+0.01)=(f(1+0.01+0.01)-f(1+0.01))/0.01= 3.0901
f'(1)=(f(1+0.01)-f(1))/0.01= 3.0301

In this way we can find that:

f''(1)= (3.0901-3.0301)/0.01 = 6

Besides f''(x)=6x
So f''(1)=6



We can understand that the approximation given is the same
