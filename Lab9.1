At the beginning we have the formula for the forward difference method:

f' (x0) = (f(x0+h)-f(x0))/h

So for h=0.01
f'(1)=(f(1+0.01)-f(1))/0.01= 3.0301

for h=1

f'(1)=(f(1+1)-f(1))/1= 7

Thanks to the analytically value the result is this:

f'(1)= 3*1**2=3

We understand that with the smallest h the greater precision there will be
